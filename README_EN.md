Analysis requirements:

* build at least 6 visualizations (at least 4 visualizations of different types, obligatorily including boxplot, heatmap, scatter plot matrix);
* each visualization is properly designed and readable even out of context;
* for each visualization, it is necessary to write a conclusion (what hypothesis can be put forward on its basis?).

[Link to the project](https://github.com/AlinaKostiuk/MazeGame/blob/main/README.md)

[Video Demo](https://youtu.be/TgwzuXTsVyc)

A game in which you need to find your way out of a procedurally generated maze with the help of text commands.

By default, the player can choose from 3 levels of difficulty.

Additional challenge is introduced by not redrawing the map after every move, though the player can request to see the map with their current position at any moment.

Originally, the game was created as the final project for Harvard's "CS50P. CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python".
